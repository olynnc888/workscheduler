## Project Title
Challenege 5 Work Scheduler 

## Description
Wrote Javascript code in order to create a work schedule that can save input text in each hour slot, shows the current time, and changed schedule color based on time of day.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## What was Done
Crafted the Javascript file, called on the DOM, and utilized if-then statements to make sure each section is shown properly. Also called on local storage.
